	<h2 id="sec-trash">Why Trash?</h2>
	
	<p>The reason I decided to record my trash was that I wanted to know what types of items I am throwing out in a week. It can be easy to mindlessly throw away things without thinking about why or what will happen to those items. Especially because many people today do not separate their items into the proper disposal categories. I was particularly inspired by a few articles I read about trash and the way we think about it. <a href = "https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash"> Professor Sarah Newman</a> writes about how our current concept of waste has not always existed. I also read a NYT article where <a href = "https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash"> Vik Muniz</a> talks about how we can reimagine our trash to have different uses.</p>
	<p>By the end of the week, I am hoping to have a better understanding of the items I decide to throw out. I know that trash can say a lot about a person, such as their hobbies, interests, foods they eat, etc. I would like to be a more mindful consumer and see if there's a way for me to reduce my impact on the environment, whether it’s through repurposing items or buying second-hand items in the future. I read <a href = "https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash"> Emily Batdorf's</a> article where she documented her week of trash and I thought doing a similar reflection myself would be helpful</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="sec-threw">What I Threw Out</h2>
	<p>This week, I noticed there was a lot of variety in the items I threw out. When I think of the trash I create in a week, I only think of the food I throw out. While there was some food waste, I also noticed I tend to hold on to small items for a long time. I have a lot of items that I no longer have use for, but for some reason I don’t want to throw them away, so I end up keeping them. These items don’t necessarily serve a purpose in my day-to-day life other than making more clutter on my desk, so I found it interesting to see the types of items I held onto. </p>
	
	<h2>Experiences</h2>
	<p>The first category of items I threw out was items that had an experience attached to them. First, I had a plastic <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiara"> tiara</a>. The tiara is gold and headband-shaped with many plastic diamonds covering the front. The tiara is cheap costume jewelry I brought with my Halloween costume in October for a Tiana costume. I wore the costume twice during Halloween week when I was with my friends,but I have not had use for the crown since. I was keeping it because it felt like a waste to throw it away so soon but it ultimately has no place in my room and I have no use for it. The second item is a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill" > playbill</a> from when I went to see Hamilton. The playbill is a small booklet printed on glossy paper containing information about the cast and crew involved with the show as well as advertisements for other Broadway shows. This item is special to me because it was from the ten-year anniversary of Hamilton being on Broadway and one of the original cast members returned for a limited time. I received tickets to attend this show with my sister as a birthday gift. I’ve held onto the item for a while because Hamilton was one of the first pieces of theater I got into so the playbill feels special to have. I am throwing it out because I also have a poster that is on my wall from this day so I don't have a reason to keep the playbill as well. </p>
		
	<h2>All Used Up</h2>
	<p>My second category of items was things that once contained something that I used up. First I have my <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Airspun-Translucent-Setting-Foundation-Lightweight/dp/B000BNG4VU?th=1" > setting powder</a>. The powder is from a brand called “Airspun” and has an orange lid with a design on it. Inside it has the powder and a small puff to apply it with. The setting powder is something I use most days while getting ready, either as the last step of my makeup or to prevent my skin from getting oily throughout the day. I have used up almost all of the powder so now I am throwing it out. My second item is a pack of <a href = "https://www.extragum.com/"> Extra gum</a>. It is a pack of the polar ice flavor and it is one of the larger packages that come in a plastic container. I keep this container of gum on my desk in my dorm for when I am studying and need something extra to help me focus and keep me awake. There is only one stick of gum left in the container so after taking it out I threw the container away. My last item in this category is a pack of <a href = "https://www.oreo.com/"> Oreos</a>. The package is a small sleeve of four oreos.  The outside is blue with a drawing of four oreos on it and the logo. I got this package from Cafe West when I went to get something for lunch.</p>
		
	<h2>No Longer Needed</h2>
	<p>The last category is items that stopped serving me a purpose. The first item is the package my <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling-Waterproof-Earphones/dp/B0D95TFG2G/ref=sxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.725e10a1-57f4-4492-8b7c-8d466bc87003%3Aamzn1.sym.725e10a1-57f4-4492-8b7c-8d466bc87003&cv_ct_cx=wireless&keywords=wireless&pd_rd_i=B0D95TFG2G&pd_rd_r=8f6befb1-b560-4465-a534-f8de8780bd5d&pd_rd_w=eNzVC&pd_rd_wg=QI7yd&pf_rd_p=725e10a1-57f4-4492-8b7c-8d466bc87003&pf_rd_r=E2SS46CTT9HH6JR4XRAQ&qid=1771195443&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-1-6e60e730-e094-43e9-99e8-1a4854cd27ff-spons&aref=AbSs6XnPkK&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&th=1"> wireless earbuds</a> came in. It is a white cardboard sleeve with a drawing of the earbuds on the cover and the brand name. I am throwing out the case because I only needed the earbuds that were inside it. I purchased these earbuds because I like listening to music while I am walking around campus, on the bus, or working, but I misplaced my AirPods over break and wanted to replace them with a cheap alternative. My second item is a small <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck"> rubber duck</a>. It is a classic yellow duck with an orange beak except it is a lot smaller than the typical rubber duck. To be honest I'm not sure why I own this duck or why I kept it but I figured it was probably time to move it off my desk. The third item is a pink <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouch"> pouch</a>. It is made of a light see-through material and has silver stars and moons all around it. I first got this pouch when I bought a pair of earrings, and they were sent using it. I kept the pouch to take my earring to and from school but recently the string holding it together broke so I now have no reason to keep it. The last item in this category is a single <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring"> earring</a>. It is shaped like a spoon and has a design on it. The spoon used to be gold but it was a cheap piece of jewelry so the original color has faded. I got these earrings in a tea-themed set from Hot Topic and used to wear them often. I still wear the other, but I am throwing this one out because I lost the second earring and it has been long enough that I don’t think I'll find it.</p>

	<p>Thank you for reading about my week of trash! I know reading about garbage can seem a little dull but it's an important thing for us to reflect on. We each produce so much trash each day without thinking about what we are tossing or why. By taking the time to slow down and reflect on what we get rid of in a week we can become more conscious consumers. Ultimately we want to help leave a better environment for the next generation and being aware of the waste we produce is a great start. </p>
