	<h2 id = "sec-desc">Description</h2>
	
	<p>My <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playbill" > playbill</a> is from when I went to see Hamilton for my birthday. The playbill has the standard yellow banner on top that says “playbill” and has the theater where the show took place underneath. (Richard Rodgers Theater) I went to see the show during its ten year celebration so it had the Hamilton logo in the center but it is spelled “Hamilten” and has ten stars around the center logo.</p>
	
	<p>Inside the front cover of the playbill is a small slip of paper describing which actors will be going on for that specific performance. The next couple pages contain miscellaneous ads including ones for other broadway shows nearby. Then there are pages describing the cast including the actors, their understudies and the crew that works on the show such as the musicians, director, stage managers, etc. The playbill then goes back to having a few more ads in the last couple of pages.</p>

	<h2 id ="sec-anec">Anecdote</h2>
	<p>On the day I went to see the show I attended with my sister because we had both gotten tickets for our birthdays. I had seen the touring cast of Hamilton a couple years before but I was excited for this show specifically because one of the original cast members was returning to the show for a <a href = "https://playbill.com/production/hamilton-broadway-richard-rodgers-theatre-2015" > limited time</a>.</p>
	
	<p>We were seeing the show a few days after our birthday because my sister goes to school in georgia so we decided she would come to Rutgers to visit me that weekend and stay over in my dorm while she was here. Hamilton was one of the first pieces of theater we both got into, so going to the city to see Hamilton was exciting for both of us.</p>
